## ELSR dataset
ELSR is trained on the REDS dataset, composed of sets of 300 videos each with a different degradation. This model is trained on a drastically reduced version of the dataset, containing only 30 videos with lower resolution (the original dataset was too big for me to train). The dataset (h5 files) is available at the following link: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/158bbeXr6EtCiuLI5wSh3SYRWMaWxK0Mq?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/158bbeXr6EtCiuLI5wSh3SYRWMaWxK0Mq?usp=sharing)
